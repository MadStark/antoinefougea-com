Unity C# programmer, shader wizard in the making, game maker wannabe. I use development to bring my dreams to life.

I make games, shaders and VFX, Unity editor scripts, but also back-end services to support all of those. I worked for over 7 years in Unity, especially in virtual reality. 

I am always eager to learn and share my experience.
